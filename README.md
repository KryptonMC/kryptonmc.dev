## Abandoned

This as been abandoned in favor of a hanger instance which should be on https://plugins.kryptonmc.org because Aidan is uninspired to finish it and Hanger seems pretty epic.

## Stack

This was going to be made using Next.js for the frontend and Spring, Postgres and Kotlin for the backend. If you want custom plugin repository harrass Aidan on twitter or discord.
